üñºÔ∏è HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PICTURE:

SUPER SIMPLE - 3 STEPS:

1. Save your photo as "profile.jpg" 
2. Put it in the "public/assets/" folder 
3. Refresh your browser

THAT'S IT! 

Your photo should appear automatically. If you already have the waterfall photo from earlier, just rename it to "profile.jpg" and put it in public/assets/

The code will automatically:
- Load your photo if it exists
- Show the placeholder icon if no photo is found
- Handle any errors gracefully

File requirements:
- Name: profile.jpg (exactly)
- Location: public/assets/profile.jpg
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square works best)
